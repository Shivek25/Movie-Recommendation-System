# Movie-Recommendation-System
#### Movie Recommendation System using Python. I have used 100K Data Set for the movies.

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project is a simple yet effective movie recommendation system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The system recommends movies based on user ratings and the similarity between movies.

### Features
- Recommends movies based on user input.
- Uses correlation between movie ratings to find similar movies.
- Filters out movies with less than a specified number of ratings to improve recommendation quality.

### Data
Ensure you have the necessary movie ratings data in a suitable format. The dataset should contain user ratings for various movies, which will be used to compute the correlations and generate recommendations.

### Acknowledgements
- This project uses movie rating data to generate recommendations.
- Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and inspiration.
